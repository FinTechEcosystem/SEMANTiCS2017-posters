      <h1>Abstract</h1>

      <p>The fintech ecosystem is a highly dynamic environment. Venture investment in fintech grew
      by 11% to $17.4 billion in 2016 according to
      <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/lawrencewintermeyer/2017/02/17/global-fintech-vc-investment-soars-in-2016">Forbes</a>
      and <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/innovatefinance/the-2016-vc-fintech-investment-landscape-71849828/1">Pitchbook</a>.
      Having a clear picture of this ecosystem at a given point in time is much needed to inform policy activities
      as evidenced by the European Commission call for tenders SMART 2016/0042. This paper describes our approach
      to integrating, enriching and presenting data about the fintech ecosystem. It presents <em>FintechBrowser</em>,
      a demonstrator of an integrated set of dashboards and a graph explorative-browsing tool.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h1>Introduction</h1>

      <p>Over the past decade we have witnessed technology-driven innovations that disrupted the financial
      services industry and continue to do so. In consumer payments, nascent start-ups are able to bring to
      market affordable and flexible cross-border payment solutions outperforming some of the largest
      traditional financial institutions. In the funding space, the rise of crowd-funding democratised
      access-to-capital creating a whole new market segment. In investment management, robo-advisors renewed
      the faith of many in the applications of Artificial Agents while providing satisfying results at
      competitive costs. Disruption caught-up even with currencies - one of the oldest concepts in the
      financial industry - with the proliferation of crypto-currencies using blockchain technologies.</p>

      <p>Having a clear picture of this ecosystem at a given point in time is much needed to inform policy
      activities as evidenced by the European Commission call for tenders SMART 2016/0042. Our research
      is focussed on exploring the fintech ecosystem using ontological modelling. It seeks, inter alia, to
      improve our understanding of this ecosystem, which is a critically important environment from which
      solutions to operational risks at financial institutions frequently arise. We combine novel knowledge
      representation and data modelling techniques to reveal links between concepts represented in the data
      which otherwise are not accessible. We use semantic web standards to free data from tables &amp;
      spreadsheets and to enrich it with linked open data. We visualise data through the lens of our ontology
      and present it on a map and in a navigable graph.</p>

      <p>The rest of the paper is structured as follows. In <a href="#SectionTowardsAFintechKnowledgeGraph"> </a>
      we describe our approach to building a fintech knowledge graph<a href="#ftn1"></a>. In
      <a href="#SectionFintechBrowserToNavigateTheGraph"></a> we present FintechBrowser<a href="#ftn2"></a>,
      a tool for presenting and navigating the fintech knowledge graph. Finally, in
      <a href="#SectionConclusions"></a> we conclude the paper and outline on-going work to extend the knowledge
      graph and FintechBrowser.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="SectionTowardsAFintechKnowledgeGraph">
      <h1>Towards a fintech knowledge graph</h1>
      <p>Current semantic web specifications <a href="#BrickleyRDFSchema"></a> <a href="#McGuinnessOWLOverview"></a>
      <a href="#HarrisSPARQL"></a> and tools <a href="#MusenProtege"></a> <a href="#McBrideJena"></a>
      <a href="#ApacheJena"></a> allow to represent a domain by documenting its concepts and the relationships
      between them, to source data instantiating this representation from heterogeneous sources and to perform
      automated reasoning to draw inferences and deductions from data following the domain representation. We
      build on these capabilities in order to construct the nucleus of a knowledge graph of the fintech ecosystem.
      Ehrlinger &amp; Wöß <a href="#EhrlingerDefinitionKnowledgeGraphs"></a> outline that a knowledge graph is
      <q>somehow superior to a knowledge base</q> as a knowledge graph <q>acquires and integrates information into
      an ontology and applies a reasoner to derive new knowledge</q>. At the heart of this fintech knowledge
      graph is our OWL fintech ontology. We enrich the latter with custom-built layers of extensions to include
      additional domain knowledge and by tapping into, and reusing knowledge from, the Linked Open Data Cloud.
      <a href="#SectionConclusions"></a> outlines our plan to evolve this knowledge base into a knowledge graph.</p>

      <section>
        <h1>Building an ontology of the fintech ecosystem</h1>
        <p>We follow a Design Science approach in building our ontology <a href="#HevnerDesignScience"></a>.
        With the objective of maximising our ontology's chances of reuse, we pay special attention to guidelines
        2 and 4 on the relevance of the research and the value of the contribution as described by Hevner et al.
        To this end, we have assembled an advisory committee of domain experts in financial services, in fintech
        and in technology <a href="#FintechEcosystem"></a> to observe, assist and assess. The ontology architecture
        is described in <a href="#FigureOntologyArchitecture"></a> (Top left). A core module contains definitions
        of OWL classes, object properties and restrictions representing the main actors of the fintech ecosystem
        and the relationships among them. Extension modules build on top of the core one to add further concepts
        as we learn about them or as they become relevant to the applications/queries this ontology underpins.
        For example, we are designing an extension to represent innovation programs and accelerators and another
        extension to represent conferences and industry events. In addition to these two layers and as our study
        evolves, the time dimension is becoming more and more relevant to support for example queries about people
        changing roles or investment trends over time. To this end, we are adding time-related information to some
        concepts, roles and relationships. The ontology metrics of the current version of our core ontology module
        are highlighted in <a href="#FigureOntologyArchitecture"></a> (Right) in a screenshot from Protégé
        <a href="#MusenProtege"></a>.</p>

      <section>
        <h1>Validating and enriching the ontology</h1>
        <p>In our Design Science approach and following guidelines 3 and 5 on evaluation and rigour
        <a href="#HevnerDesignScience"></a>, we gathered a set of queries that the first version of
        the ontology should help answer. This is in-line with ontology engineering best practices and
        widely referenced guidelines <a href="#UscholdOntologies"></a> <a href="#Fernandez-LopezMethontology"></a>.
        <a href="#FigureOntologyArchitecture"></a> (Bottom left) shows an excerpt of these questions.
        As we were capturing these key competency questions, we were able to identify classes and entities
        which are highlighted between quotes in <a href="#FigureOntologyArchitecture"></a> (Bottom left) and
        which made their way to our ontology.</p>

        <p>The Linked Open Data community is growing steadily <a href="#BauerLinkedOpenData"></a>
        <a href="#BizerLinkedData"></a> and in particular Dbpedia <a href="#AuerDbpedia"></a> contains
        knowledge relevant to this study. We link to Dbpedia to obtain information, for example, about
        locations, cities and population sizes. We use this linked data in queries such as the second one
        described in <a href="#FigureOntologyArchitecture"></a> (Bottom left), where we correlate technologies
        with services and locations of firms and then filter by the size of the population in this (these)
        location(s). Another source of knowledge we are currently working on linking to, is the Financial
        Industry Business Ontology (FIBO). FIBO is an initiative supported by many institutions
        <a href="#BennettTheFinancialIndustryBusinessOntology"></a>. Modules of FIBO are undergoing the Objet
        Management Group's rigorous standardisation process <a href="#FinancialServicesStandardsFIBO"></a>.
        In particular, FIBO Business Entities and its modules contain knowledge relevant to this study such
        as the definitions of entities and corporations and also individuals representing a wide array of
        regulators in different jurisdictions.</p>

    <section id="SectionFintechBrowserToNavigateTheGraph">
      <h1>FintechBrowser to navigate the graph</h1>
      <p>The architecture of FintechBrowser is illustrated in <a href="#FigureFintechBrowserArchitecture"></a>.
      A front-end sits on top of the knowledge graph. It allows the user to express queries by selecting
      filtering criteria and constraining them. FintechBrowser then translates these user queries into SPARQL
      queries that are executed against the graph. FintechBrowser allows the user to visualise and navigate
      the knowledge graph. It has three main front-end views: 1) a list view, 2) a map view, and 3) a graph
      view. All three views are controlled by the aforementioned set of selection criteria and filters.</p>

      <figure id="FigureFintechBrowserArchitecture">
        <p>
          <img src="img/fintechbrowser-architecture.png" alt="FintechBrowser's software architecure"/>
        </p>
        <figcaption>
          Software architecture of FintechBrowser.
        </figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>For experimentation purposes, we loaded a test dataset containing information about 200+ fintech
      firms, banks and investors located in Europe, the United States and Africa. In the map view, we were
      able to see the how the firms where geographically clustered and distributed with just a glance at the
      screen. This was facilitated by SPARQL queries launched at runtime to Dbpedia in order to retrieve geographic
      coordinates of firms' locations. In the graph navigation view, we were able to explore for each node
      in the graph all the nodes linked to it. See for example screenshot in <a href="#FigureFintechBrowserInterface"></a>
      where the user started from a firm providing a compliance analysis service, navigated to another one using the
      same technology: blockchain, to see that the second firm uses the same technology but for a different
      service, namely payment.</p>

      <figure id="FigureFintechBrowserInterface">
        <p>
          <img src="img/fintechbrowser-interface.png" alt="FintechBrowser's main interface"/>
        </p>
        <figcaption>
          Screenshot of FintechBrowser in the graph navigation view.
        </figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>One major advantage of this approach is that some of these links were not asserted in the original
      dataset but rather inferred at runtime using the domain description in the ontology. For instance, in
      response to the query: <em>list all investors who have invested in (a company that is located in) Dublin</em>,
      the system was able to follow the property chain: <code>(investor) investedInRound (investmentRound) +
      (company) hasReceivedInvestmentInRound (investmentRound) + (company) isLocatedIn (city)</code> in order to infer
      <code>(investor) investedInCity (city)</code>. Furthermore, the location attribute in the ontology,
      combined with instance data from Dbpedia allowed the system to automatically answer queries such as
      the second one described in <a href="#FigureOntologyArchitecture"></a> (Bottom left).</p>

      <p>As it stands, FintechBrowser operates on manually collected data, which we believe is an impediment
      to it reaching its full potential and helping us improve our understanding of the fintech ecosystem. We
      are exploring a series of algorithms to automatically (or semi-automatically) collect instance data and
      evolve our knowledge base to a knowledge graph <a href="#EhrlingerDefinitionKnowledgeGraphs"></a>.
      We are evaluating Named Entity Recognition and other Natural Language Processing techniques to populate
      the graph from different sources including company websites and news. With more data continuously being
      added and time-stamped, it is our expectation that through this study we will be able to deepen our
      understanding of this ecosystem by exploring the impact of criteria such as "education", "tax rates", etc.
      on fintech performance expressed in terms of number of "deal values", "patents", etc. at a given "location",
      and in a subsequent step to explore scenarios of future development of the fintech ecosystem.</p>
