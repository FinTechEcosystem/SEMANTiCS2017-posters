         <h1>Abstract</h1>
         <p>In this research paper, we present the results of the analysis conducted on Freeyork.org, a design blog from Poland that has been&#xD; using WordLift, a plugin for WordPress, for a period of 6 months to&#xD;automatically add the semantic markup for improving its online&#xD; visibility.&#xD;</p>
         <p>WordLift<a href="#ftn0"> </a> analyses articles using Named Entity Recognition&#xD; (NER) and Named Entity Disambiguation (NED). The entities are ex-tracted from different knowledge graphs including but not limited&#xD; to DBpedia, GeoNames and Wikidata. WordLift provides UIs for&#xD; creating and curating custom vocabularies. The plugin implements&#xD; a semi-automated annotation workflow and publishes metadata by&#xD; asynchronously injecting a JSON-LD<a href="#ftn4"> </a> on-page and by publishing&#xD; linked (open) data in the cloud using Apache Marmotta: an open implementation of a Linked Data Platform<a href="#ftn5"> </a>. Metrics used to measure&#xD; the impact of structured data are based on organic search results&#xD; as opposed to paid links (i.e. advertisement), that is to <strong>measure&#xD; the position of a web site in the search results solely based&#xD; on the ranking of the web site related to the search terms</strong>&#xD; entered by the end user. So that a user entering a web site from&#xD; an organic search result is considered an organic session and the&#xD; traffic generated by this user is defined as organic traffic (vs. paid&#xD; traffic, i.e. traffic generated by a sponsored or advertised link).&#xD;</p>
         <p>In this analysis, we used Google Analytics to collect and analyze&#xD; traffic data, over the course of 6 months and we could see that&#xD; linked structured data helps semantic search engines like Google&#xD; provide better results to their users and indirectly improves the&#xD; traffic of a website. This has been measured by comparing both&#xD; quantitative metrics like pageviews and sessions and qualitative&#xD; metrics like time spent on page and session duration.&#xD;</p>
         <p>Our goal was to measure organic traffic (page views and sessions)&#xD; and engagement (time spent on the pages and number of page-&#xD;views per session) considered as key performance indicators for the website. Since Freeyork.org has an advertising based business&#xD; model, organic traffic is crucial to drive revenues.&#xD;</p>
         <p>Here follow the highlights:&#xD;</p>
         <ul>
            <li>
               <p>After the first three months <strong>WordLift improved the number of organic sessions and the number of new users&#xD; with a double digit growth</strong> (+ 12.13% of new users).&#xD;</p>
            </li>
            <li>
               <p>
                  <strong>Google seems to be faster, compared to Bing and Yandex, in indexing and promoting articles that use WordLift’s&#xD; semantic markup</strong>. In the first three months we have seen&#xD; a 18.47% increase of sessions from Google, comparing with&#xD; the previous period. Other search engines like Bing and&#xD; Yandex have also provided more visits to the articles but&#xD; only after the second and third month of activity.&#xD;</p>
            </li>
            <li>
               <p>On average, <strong>pages enriched with WordLift</strong> (featuring&#xD; the schema.org markup that the software provides), compared with all the other pages, <strong>are performing 2.4 times&#xD; better</strong> in terms of page views and in terms of sessions.&#xD;</p>
            </li>
            <li>
               <p>
                  <strong>The average time spent on enriched articles is also&#xD; improved by 17.3%</strong> in comparison to the rest of the website that is not annotated.&#xD;</p>
            </li>
            <li>
               <p>
                  <strong>The average session duration is improved by 13.75%</strong>&#xD; when articles are enriched.&#xD;</p>
            </li>
            <li>
               <p>A glossary of terms, like the one that WordLift automatically creates, has a p<strong>ositive impact in extending the&#xD; length of users’ sessions</strong> but has little or no impact on&#xD; search traffic unless content is original and curated.</p>
            </li>
         </ul>

         <h1>Introduction – What we learned</h1>
         <p>When creating a SaaS like WordLift whose mission is to automate&#xD; digital marketing tasks and to improve the visibility of websites,&#xD; testing the product’s assumptions by looking at the web metrics&#xD; with a methodical approach, is an integral part of our product&#xD; development.&#xD;</p>
         <p>We have been focusing our effort in creating a semi-automated&#xD; workflow to improve the impact of organic traffic on websites, to&#xD; reduce the time spent by editors in enriching articles and to improve&#xD; the user experience of the readers thanks to meaningful navigation&#xD; widgets <a href="#__RefHeading__456_683783752"> </a>.&#xD;</p>
         <p>As obvious as it might sound, not all websites are made equal&#xD; and, just like any other business, each website has its own unique&#xD; strengths and weaknesses. The following study focuses on a community driven blog from Poland accessible on the Internet as freeyork.org. The blog helps artists and designers promote and share&#xD; their stories and their artwork.&#xD;</p>
         <p>When analysing clients’ data our goal is twofold:&#xD;</p>
         <ul>
            <li>
               <p>prove that our hypothesis are wrong (or right) in order to&#xD; improve WordLift&#xD;</p>
            </li>
            <li>
               <p>provide the client with actionable recommendations to&#xD; grow their business&#xD;</p>
            </li>
         </ul>
         <p>Samur, co-founder and CEO of the news organization behind Freeyork, started using WordLift in January 2017 fito add intelligencefi to&#xD; his WordPress site and to cope with a decreasing amount of traffic&#xD; coming from search engines (organic sessions between October&#xD; 2016 and December 2016, when compared to the previous three&#xD; months, had been constantly decreasing).</p>
      </section>
      <section>
         <h1>Methodology used and results</h1>
         <p>In <a href="#refIllustration0"> </a> we’re looking at the traffic coming from the organic&#xD; search in the first 3 months after installing WordLift (January /&#xD; March 2017) compared to the previous period (October / December&#xD;2016).</p>
         <figure id="refIllustration0">
            <p>
               <img src="img/10000201000003CF0000009BC0D1F65B.png"
                    alt="Sessions from organic search (orange = October /December 2016; blue = January / March 2017)"/>
            </p>
            <figcaption>Sessions from organic search (orange = October /December 2016; blue = January / March 2017)</figcaption>
         </figure>
         <p>It is interesting to see that Google has been the fastest search&#xD; engine to boost the enriched content over its SERPs and to bring&#xD; new traffic to the site (we have seen an <strong>increase of 18.47% for&#xD; traffic coming from Google</strong> in the first three months). Yandex&#xD; and Bing started to contribute more after the second and the third&#xD; month.</p>
         <figure>
            <p>
               <img src="img/10000201000001C30000009D2BA22A09.png"
                    alt="Percentage change of organic traffic between October - December 2016 and January - March 2017"/>
            </p>
            <figcaption>Percentage change of organic traffic between October - December 2016 and January - March 2017</figcaption>
         </figure>
         <p>The Page/Session ratio also increased slightly by a 1.96%. Freeyork is currently running with a WordLift configuration that automatically adds links on articles for every annotated occurrence of a detected named entity. This setting has been designed to drive more&#xD; traffic from articles to entity pages. Since entity pages have not&#xD; been curated by the team, the impact in terms of traffic has been&#xD;minimal (around 0.25% on the total in terms of pageviews). <strong>Entities, unless curated, don’t attract organic traffic and their&#xD; impact on the user experience also remains low.&#xD;</strong>
         </p>
         <p>Now the main issue, in terms of insights that we could extract&#xD; from this analysis of the traffic, was that out of 13.500 pages indexed&#xD; by Google only 1.661 articles have been annotated and enriched&#xD;with WordLift. The annotation process has not been consistent, due&#xD; to the fact that some editors did use WordLift while others didnfit.&#xD; WordLift was used starting from January 2017 and in the beginning&#xD; only a small percentage of articles had been annotated. As the team&#xD; become more accustomed to the new workflow the percentage of&#xD; annotated articles increased. In May, June and July 2017 the team&#xD; produced 667 articles and yet only 363 (54.4%) have been annotated&#xD; with WordLift.&#xD;</p>
         <p>The vocabulary currently features 2.684 entities but, as said, the&#xD; impact in terms of traffic was minimal due to the fact that entities&#xD; have not been curated from the editorial point of view. WordLift&#xD; retrieves content for each entity using linked data graphs such as&#xD; DBpedia and Wikidata or other controlled vocabularies that the&#xD; client might decide to use. Content is meant to guide the editor in&#xD;personalizing each term; it can be done using WordPress just like&#xD; any other blog post.</p>
         <figure>
            <p>
               <img src="img/1000020100000237000000D8586509E1.png"
                    alt="Annotated posts and Entity pages"/>
            </p>
            <figcaption>Annotated posts and Entity pages</figcaption>
         </figure>
         <p>We were curious to dive deeper into the data in order to understand how much the articles enriched with WordLift were really&#xD; contributing to the traffic of the website.&#xD;</p>
         <p>It was therefore decided to pull data from Google Analytics&#xD; and to combine it with data from &lt;data.wordlift.io&gt; (this is&#xD; the linked data platform where the linked knowledge graph of&#xD; Freeyork is stored). Using a SPARQL query we could extract the list&#xD; of the URLs of the annotated articles (they are marked up with the&#xD; property http://schema.org/BlogPosting) and the list of the&#xD; URLs of entities (their &lt;rdf:type&gt; - the class associated with each&#xD; named entity - is one of the types of the schema.org vocabulary&#xD; that WordLift supports<a href="#ftn1"> </a>).&#xD;</p>
         <p>Using a VLOOKUP function on Google Spreadsheet we combined the two datasets and could finally see the performance of&#xD; the annotated articles in comparison with the rest of the website&#xD; for the following metrics: number of sessions, number of page&#xD; views, average time spent on page, average duration per session&#xD; and bounce rate.</p>
         <p>We used the add-on of Google Analytics for Google Spreadsheet&#xD;<a href="#ftn6"> </a>. This is a precious tool but can only output 10.000 results at the&#xD; time. We therefore configured the Add-on to extract the top 10.000&#xD; pages sorted by number of sessions and by number of page views&#xD; (we wanted to run the analysis on the pages that had the biggest&#xD; impact on the website for the selected metrics); this could be done&#xD; in our case by adding -ga:sessions, -ga:pageviews in the sort&#xD; field of the configuration panel of the Google Analytics Add-On.&#xD;</p>
         <p>We focused on pageviews and sessions after the talks that we&#xD; had with Samur as these are the metrics that he cares the most: the&#xD; magazinefis revenues are driven primarily by advertising.&#xD;</p>
         <p>We wanted to look this time at the overall traffic of the website&#xD; and not just at the organic portion of it. We also looked at a different&#xD; time frame (the period from April to June) to ensure that results&#xD; from WordLift remained consistent over time.</p>
         <section>
            <h1>Measuring the impact of enriched articles</h1>
            <p>The impact on all key metrics for enriched articles - compared to&#xD; the rest of the website - has been positive and rewarding for the&#xD; team at Freeyork and of course for us as well.&#xD;</p>
            <p>In the results below post is used for pages enriched with WordLift&#xD; and KO is used for any other page that have not been enriched with&#xD; WordLift. The formulas being used to extract the averages below&#xD; aggregate all values for each type (post and KO) related to each metric. The analyzed metrics are: sessions (ga:sessions), pageviews&#xD; (ga:pageviews), average time on page (ga:avgTimeOnPage) and&#xD; bounce rate (ga:bounceRate). More information on how Google&#xD; Analytics aggregates data and a definition of each metric is available on the online documentation provided by Google Analytics&#xD;documentation<a href="#ftn2"> </a>.</p>

         <h1>Few more insights from this study and how to help Wordlift become an even better SEO tool &#xD;</h1>
         <ul>
            <li>
               <p>Structure is more important than we might think. In RankBrain’s&#xD; era ensuring the best user experience to humans is key to&#xD; stand out on Search pages. The more we are able to <strong>provide consistency to our readers by organizing content around the concepts that matters </strong>and the more&#xD; the dwell time on our site increases. At the same time, content curation is costly and editors need to focus their&#xD; attention to core entities only. Out of the 2.684 entities a list&#xD; of the most interconnected entities can help us understand&#xD; what wefire talking about and where editors should put&#xD; their focus in the next future. These entities are the ones&#xD; that have the highest number of relationships with both&#xD; articles and other entities in the graph of the website that&#xD; WordLift creates. We usually rely on the DBpedia ontology&#xD; to gain a first insight on the content of website by looking&#xD; at the different types of entities that a blog is using. As&#xD; shown in the chart below we could see that people, namely&#xD; designers, play a central role in Freeyork.</p>
               <figure>
                  <p>
                     <img src="img/100002010000026F0000015AB0677FF7.png"
                          alt="Most used entities organized by type (DBpedia Ontology)"/>
                  </p>
                  <figcaption>Most used entities organized by type (DBpedia Ontology)</figcaption>
               </figure>
               <p>(dbpo:Agent, dbpo:Person, dbpo:Artist) followed by&#xD; the places where artists work and exhibit (dbpo:Place,&#xD; dbpo:PopulatedPlace, dbpo:Settlement, dbpo:Country)&#xD; and at last the organizations they deal with (dbpo:Organization&#xD; and dbpo:Company) and the artwork that they produce&#xD; (dbpo:Work). This is a good starting point that we can augment further by looking at the top 20 entities of the website. </p>
               <figure>
                  <p>
                     <img src="img/10000201000003AA00000177334C6715.png"
                          alt="Most recurring entities"/>
                  </p>
                  <figcaption>Most recurring entities</figcaption>
               </figure>
               <p>This list of interconnected entities is still quite raw and&#xD; could be further cleaned and refined; nevertheless, even&#xD; without adding more details to it, this data can help us see&#xD; that: photography, sculpture, illustration, art installations&#xD; and paintings are the most important clusters to group&#xD; artists and designers on the Freeyork website. Tools like&#xD; WordLift shall bring this data into the hands of bloggers&#xD; and editorial teams to help them focus on writing content&#xD; that fits within their existing editorial plan.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
               <p>As editors focus their effort on the most important concepts&#xD; in their vocabulary we can probably expect more traffic&#xD; coming to entities pages. We can also, at that point, start to&#xD; <strong>increase the average session duration </strong>even more (assuming that this fits with the business goals of the website)&#xD; by adding navigation widgets such as the navigator and&#xD; the faceted search widget. These widgets in WordLift complement with the links that WordLift adds to drive users&#xD; from articles to entity pages and are designed to improve&#xD; the time a user spends on your website before moving&#xD; somewhere else (this metric is tightly connected with the&#xD;concept of dwell time). In the charts below we can see&#xD; how WordLift’s articles, while keeping users slightly more&#xD; time on each page, tend also to extend the duration of the&#xD; session. More internal links help readers discover more&#xD; content on the website and have indirectly a positive impact on search engine rankings. We assume that by adding&#xD; navigation widgets to a website like Freeyork this effect&#xD; can be boosted.</p>

            <li>
               <p>A lot of pages - on large websites - donfit get much traffic or&#xD; donfit get traffic at all. <strong>Pruning content in some cases&#xD; is a good option to ensure that your visitors, both humans and machines, really get the best of your site&#xD; at their first encounters</strong>. When pruning is not an option&#xD; (you need to have time and resources to do a comprehensive content audit) - we can at least ensure that crawlers&#xD; donfit waste their time on indexing content that is not&#xD; strategic for your website. Letfis be more specific: while&#xD; itfis true that publishing more relevant content around a&#xD; particular topic improves your ranking for that topic, sometimes therefis actually more value in keeping certain pages&#xD; on your website out of a search engine’s index. When&#xD; pages are not high-quality, when they are not properly&#xD; curated and they donfit have clear call to actions - they can&#xD; still be helpful for readers trying to get a clue of an article&#xD;- but might not perform well over search. In these specific&#xD; cases -<strong> adding a noindex and tell search engines to&#xD; turn away from these pages can improve the overall&#xD; authority and rankings of the website.</strong>
               </p>
               <p>In the upcoming releases, and specifically for entity pages, WordLift&#xD; shall automatically decide when it makes sense to add a noindex&#xD; tag to ensure that websites like Freeyork.org can always get the&#xD; best out of organic<a href="#ftn3"> </a>.</p>

         <h1>Conclusions</h1>
         <p>Now more than ever, as we transition from keywords-based searches&#xD; to semantic searches it has become critical for online magazines,&#xD; bloggers and digital publishers, to improve the enriched metadata&#xD; on their sites to maintain and to grow their online visibility. To&#xD; achieve this target, WordLift adds a layer of semantic annotations&#xD; that improve the crawlability and findability of web pages. The&#xD; rationale is straightforward: implementing schema.org annotations&#xD; helps search engines understand the content better, and provides&#xD; better results for end users <a href="#__RefHeading__454_683783752"> </a>.&#xD;</p>
         <p>Our on-going effort in evaluating the impact of Linked Data&#xD; technologies in search is strategic asset in our companyfis culture&#xD; and a great way to establish a virtuous feedback loop with our early&#xD; users.&#xD;</p>
         <p>As next steps we plan to extend the present methodology in&#xD; order to analyze how the impact of a tool like WordLift varies over&#xD; time for a given set of articles and to implement new functionalities&#xD; into the product for helping editors write more consistently around&#xD; the topics that really matter and for automating additional SEO&#xD; tasks (such as adding the noindex tag).</p>
