Dear volume editors,

We tried to convert the enclosed DOC version of our paper into RASH using the online conversion service <http://dasplab.cs.unibo.it/rocs> but with no success. So the enclosed RASH version of the paper was created manually. Nevertheless, we enclose the DOC and PDF so you can verify the content and the expected layout of the paper.

Yours sincerely,

Jan Kučera, Vojtěch Svátek, Jindřich Mynarz
